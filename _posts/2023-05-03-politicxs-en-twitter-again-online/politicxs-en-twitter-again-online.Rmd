From the [Network Observatory](https://twitter.com/O_de_R) together with [Democracia en Red](https://twitter.com/fundacionDER) and the [National Democratic Institute](https://twitter.com/NDI) we are excited to announce the relaunch of our [PoliticxsentwitteR website](https://oderedes.shinyapps.io/PoliticxsentwitteR/), now with updated data up to June 2022!

The app that I have the honor to develop analyzes tweets from **politicians in Argentina** ![](https://em-content.zobj.net/thumbs/120/twitter/322/flag-argentina_1f1e6-1f1f7.png){width=3% align=right} and provides insights into their **engagement, the words and emojis** that they use, and also **who retweets who**. It also provides the opportunity to **free download the tweets** so they can be analyzed and give users a more comprehensive view of political discourse on Twitter.


We hope that this update will provide valuable insights into political discourse in Argentina, and we encourage you to give it a try. You can access the app by visiting [this link](https://oderedes.shinyapps.io/PoliticxsentwitteR/)

 Another important announcement is that **[politicxsintwitteR R package](https://github.com/guadag12/politicxsentwitteR/) is also available** to make the data as much accessible as possible. In this [post](https://guadag12.github.io/politicxsentwitteR/articles/Instalacion-y-funciones.html) I showed you what opportunities the package bring! Also, you can check this [social network tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSU82auREmw&ab_channel=RLadiesBuenosAires) that I present thanks to [R ladies Buenos Aires](https://twitter.com/RLadiesBA) using [politicxsintwitteR](https://github.com/guadag12/politicxsentwitteR/).

However, how if we try to do a little network analysis as a showed up of the possibilities of the package?
