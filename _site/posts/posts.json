It also provides the opportunity to free download the tweets so they can be analyzed and give users a more comprehensive view of political discourse on Twitter.\r\nWe hope that this update will provide valuable insights into political discourse in Argentina, and we encourage you to give it a try. You can access the app by visiting this link\r\n\r\nAnother important announcement is that politicxsintwitteR R package is also available to make the data as much accessible as possible. In this post I showed you what opportunities the package bring! Also, you can check this social network tutorial that I present thanks to R ladies Buenos Aires using politicxsintwitteR.\r\nHowever, how if we try to do a little network analysis as a showed up of the possibilities of the package?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
