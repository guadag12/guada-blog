Hi! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span> I am a Computational Social Scientist who specializes in political science, and statistical analysis, social network analysis and data visualization. I am a Political Scientist and am currently pursuing a Master's degree in [Social Data Science](https://www.essex.ac.uk/courses/pg01314/1/msc-social-data-science) at the [University of Essex](essex.ac.uk) in the UK, thanks to my receipt of [Chevening Scholarship](https://www.chevening.org/). 

I've had a number of exciting roles over the years, including being a research assistant at Columbia University,  coordinated the [Network Observatory research Group](https://twitter.com/O_de_R) at the University of Buenos Aires, worked as a data analyst consultant at UNESCO, and being an advisor for the National Direction of Access to Public Information in Argentina. 

I'm also a passionate educator and have taught and coordinated several courses, including Introduction to R for Social Scientists, Machine Learning with R, and Introduction to Python. And even gave a R-ladies talk! (check it in the [workshop's section](https://guadagonzalez.com/workshops.html)!)

I have a keen interest in conducting reproducible and transparent data analysis in R. For more information, please feel free to peruse my [blog](https://guadagonzalez.com/blog.html).
